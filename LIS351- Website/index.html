				<p style="color:darkblue;"> Hello, my name is Jamie Vacca and I am a Sophomore at the <a href="https://www.wisc.edu/"> University of Wisconsin- Madison</a> majoring in Journalism and earning a certificate in Digital Studies. Iâ€™m from Weston, Connecticut, and went to Weston High School. Throughout my time at UW thus far, I have become an active member in several organizations. One of my favorite organizations I am involved with is The Fit Magazine. I write articles for The Fit. I am also the Vice President of Recruitment for my sorority, Sigma Delta Tau. Through both of these organizations as well as others, I have made a concerted effort to be an active member of the Madison community. While I have a lot of committments and not much downtime, I love settling down to watch a movie, either with friends or in the comfort of my bedroom.</p>
