			<h3><i> The Notebook </i></h3>
			<p> The Notebook is one of my favorite romance movies. The plot involves two characters who fall in love with each other. The male protagonist, however, goes away to serve in the war. While viewers think that this symbolizes the end of their relationship, there is so much more to come as the movie transpires.
